## Summary

The resulting map is meant to allow the viewer to compare earthquake data from around the world at a glance. Earthquakes are indicated with a circle marker with the color showing the magnitude, per the legend in the mapâ€™s lower left-hand corner.

Specific information about the location and the magnitude can be found by clicking a marker at which point the location and exact magnitude are displayed.

The tectonic plate boundaries are also displayed for viewer reference.
